        <p style="text-align: justify;">VigilanceHub is a platform dedicated to cybersecurity awareness. Launched in 2024, this all-in-one platform aims to enhance users' 
            knowledge in the cybersecurity field by incorporating engaging training materials and quizzes for users of all ages, regardless of their amount of prior 
            knowledge in cybersecurity.<br><br>
            The idea of developing VigilanceHub was inspired from other various full-fledged existing training platforms that are widely used by various organisations. 
            However, as some of these platforms require a paid subscription to use or only accessible if you are employed in such organisations, there is still a large
            majority of people around the world who would benefit from a free and easy awareness training platform.<br><br>
            As the cybersecurity landscape continues to grow, the developers of VigilanceHub affirmed the importance of educating users of all ages some basic cybersecurity 
            concepts that are undeniably beneficial in this world dominated by technology. Thus, VigilanceHub was born, and continues to be an easily accessible awareness 
            training platform that nurtures people in cybersecurity each day.
